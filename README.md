# T-wall Interaction Curve
This software calculates and draws T-wall interaction curves using the Compression Stress Block Model.

This software needs inputs on the physical properties of the steel and concrete, the wall section's dimensions, the vertical reinforcement distribution in the wall, and the force demands on the section.

The M_33 refers to analyzing the effect of a bending moment in the flange (bending moment parallel to the web), i.e., both ends of the flange in compression and tension stress.
The M_22 refers to analyzing the effect of a bending moment in the web (bending moment parallel to the flange), i.e., the web's end and the flange in compression and tension stress.
